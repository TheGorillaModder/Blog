        I started making programs and mods for games in early July 2022. I was bored and stumbled across all kinds
        of cool things people had made for a VR game called Gorilla Tag. I saw players flying around and doing all
        sorts of crazy stuff, and I wanted to figure out how it all worked.

        Eventually, I discovered modding tools that made it easier to install cheats and mods into the game. One
        thing led to another, and before long, I figured out how to fly and use cheats myself. That alone kept me
        entertained for months. (This was still around March at the time.)

        By late May, I started wondering how I could create mods and tools like that on my own. That’s when I came
        across an app by Microsoft called Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition. I used it to install .NET 2.1, since
        many Unity games — including Gorilla Tag — are built on it.

        I spent about 6 hours trying to understand the basics using an online template, just to see if I could make
        something, even if it wasn’t anything special. After all that time, I was still super confused, so I stepped away
        for about a week.

        When I came back in early July, something clicked. I quickly picked up the core ideas — I just needed a
        break. From there, I dove deeper. For the first 2–3 months, I studied how Unity worked and learned how to
        tweak game values to make things more fun.

        Eventually, I started making my own stuff. I enjoyed figuring it all out by myself, though sometimes I turned
        to forums when I got stuck. Since then, I've continued expanding my knowledge. I now know over 5
        programming languages.

        Moral of the story: It’s okay to take a break and come back later. Don’t stress or get frustrated — everyone
        learns at their own pace. I’ve just always happened to be a fast learner.
